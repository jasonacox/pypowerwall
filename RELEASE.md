## v0.12.5 - Normalize Alerts

* Fix an issue in TEDAPI where the grid status is not accurately reported in certain edge cases. Now, only the "SystemConnectedToGrid" alert will appear if it is present in alerts API. This update also eliminates the risk of duplicate and redundant ("SystemGridConnected") alerts and normalizes this specific alert. PR https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/pull/139 by @Nexarian

## v0.12.4 - Neurio Vitals

* Update proxy for /csv/v2 API support by @jasonacox in https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/pull/134
* Fix CTS data retrieval in TEDAPI vitals processor #136 by @jasonacox in https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/pull/137
* Fix bug in TEDAPI vitals processor that was not pulling in all Neurio CTS data. Issue reported in https://github.com/jasonacox/Powerwall-Dashboard/discussions/578#discussioncomment-12034018 and tracked in https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/issues/136.

## v0.12.3 - Custom GW IP

* Fix TEDAPI URL from constant GW_IP to constructor selectable host gw_ip by @Nexarian in https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/pull/129 - The hard-coded 192.168.91.1 for the TEDAPI internal endpoint doesn't always work if you're using NAT. This change enables support for this use-case.
* See https://gist.github.com/jasonacox/91479957d0605248d7eadb919585616c?permalink_comment_id=5373785#gistcomment-5373785 for NAP implementation example.

## v0.12.2 - Cache Expiration Fix

* http://localhost:8675/help (verify pw3 shows True) 
* http://localhost:8675/tedapi/components
* http://localhost:8675/tedapi/battery  

## v0.10.10 - Add Grid Control

* Add a function and command line options to allow user to get and set grid charging and exporting modes (see https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/issues/108).
* Supports FleetAPI and Cloud modes only (not Local mode)

#### Command Line Examples

```bash
# Connect to Cloud
python3 -m pypowerwall setup # or fleetapi

# Get Current Settings
python3 -m pypowerwall get

# Turn on Grid charging
python3 -m pypowerwall set -gridcharging on

# Turn off Grid charging
python3 -m pypowerwall  set -gridcharging off

# Set Grid Export to Solar (PV) energy only
python3 -m pypowerwall set -gridexport pv_only

# Set Grid Export to Battery and Solar energy
python3 -m pypowerwall set -gridexport battery_ok

# Disable export of all energy to grid
python3 -m pypowerwall set -gridexport never
```

#### Programming Examples

```python
import pypowerwall

# FleetAPI Mode
PW_HOST=""
PW_EMAIL="my@example.com"
pw = pypowerwall.Powerwall(host=PW_HOST, email=PW_EMAIL, fleetapi=True)

# Get modes
pw.get_grid_charging()
pw.get_grid_export()

# Set modes
pw.set_grid_charging("on") # set grid charging mode (on or off)
pw.set_grid_export("pv_only")   # set grid export mode (battery_ok, pv_only, or never)
```

## v0.10.9 - TEDAPI Voltage & Current

* Add computed voltage and current to `/api/meters/aggregates` from TEDAPI status data.
* Fix error in `num_meters_aggregated` calculation in aggregates.

## v0.10.8 - TEDAPI Firmware Version

* Add TEDAPI `get_firmware_version()` to poll Powerwall for firmware version. Discovered by @geptto in https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/issues/97. This function has been integrated into pypowerwall existing APIs (e.g. `pw.version()`)
* Add TEDAPI `get_components()` and `get_battery_block()` functions which providing additional Powerwall 3 related device vital information for Powerwall 3 owners. Discovered by @lignumaqua in https://github.com/jasonacox/Powerwall-Dashboard/discussions/392#discussioncomment-9864364. The plan it to integrate this data into the other device vitals payloads (TODO).

## v0.10.7 - Energy History

* FleetAPI - Add `get_history()` and `get_calendar_history()` to return energy, power, soe, and other history data.

```python
import pypowerwall

pw = pypowerwall.Powerwall(host=PW_HOST, email=PW_EMAIL, fleetapi=True)
pw.client.fleet.get_calendar_history(kind="soe")
pw.client.fleet.get_history(kind="power")
```

## v0.10.6 - pyLint Cleanup

* Minor Bug Fixes - TEDAPI get_reserve() fix to address unscaled results.
* pyLint Cleanup of Code

## v0.10.5 - Minor Fixes

* Fix for TEDAPI "full" (e.g. Powerwall 3) mode, including `grid_status` bug resulting in false reports of grid status, `level()` bug where data gap resulted in 0% state of charge and `alerts()` where data gap from tedapi resulted in a `null` alert.
* Add TEDAPI API call locking to limit load caused by concurrent polling.
* Proxy - Add battery full_pack and remaining energy data to `/pod` API call for all cases.

## v0.10.4 - Powerwall 3 Local API Support

* Add local support for Powerwall 3 using TEDAPI. 
* TEDAPI will activate in `hybrid` (using TEDAPI for vitals and existing local APIs for other metrics) or `full` (all data from TEDAPI) mode to provide better Powerwall 3 support.
* The `full` mode will automatically activate when the customer `password` is blank and `gw_pwd` is set.
* Note: The `full` mode will provide less metrics than `hybrid` mode since Powerwall 2/+ systems have additional APIs that are used in `hybrid` mode to fetch additional data

```python
import pypowerwall

# Activate HYBRID mode (for Powerwall / 2 / + systems)
pw = pypowerwall.Powerwall("192.168.91.1", password=PASSWORD, email=EMAIL, gw_pwd=PW_GW_PWD)

# Activate FULL mode (for all systems including Powerwall 3)
pw = pypowerwall.Powerwall("192.168.91.1", gw_pwd=PW_GW_PWD)
```

* Update `setup.py` to include dependencies on `protobuf>=3.20.0`.
* Add TEDAPI `connect()` logic to better validate Gateway endpoint access.
* Add documentation for TEDAPI setup.
* Update CLI to support TEDAPI calls.
* Proxy t60 - Fix edge case where `/csv` API will error due to NoneType inputs.
* Add TEDAPI argument to set custom GW IP address.

## v0.10.0 - New Device Vitals

* Add support for `/tedapi` API access on Gateway (requires connectivity to 192.168.91.1 GW and Gateway Password) with access to "config" and "status" data.
* Adds drop-in replacement for depreciated `/vitals` API and payload using the new TEDAPI class. This allows easy access to Powerwall device vitals.
* Proxy update to t58 to support TEDAPI with environmental variable `PW_GW_PWD` for Gateway Password. Also added FleetAPI, Cloud and TEDAPI specific GET calls, `/fleetapi`, `/cloud`, and `/tedapi` respectively.

```python
# How to Activate the TEDAPI Mode
import pypowerwall

gw_pwd = "GW_PASSWORD" # Gateway Passowrd usually on QR code on Gateway

host = "192.168.91.1" # Direct Connect to GW
pw = pypowerwall.Powerwall(host,password,email,timezone,gw_pwd=gw_pwd)
print(pw.vitals())
```

```python
# New TEDAPI Class
import pypowerwall.tedapi

tedapi = pypowerwall.tedapi.TEDAPI("GW_PASSWORD")

config = tedapi.get_config()
status = tedapi.get_status()

meterAggregates = status.get('control', {}).get('meterAggregates', [])
for meter in meterAggregates:
    location = meter.get('location', 'Unknown').title()
    realPowerW = int(meter.get('realPowerW', 0))
    print(f"   - {location}: {realPowerW}W")

```

## v0.9.1 - Bug Fixes and Updates

    get                 Get Powerwall Settings and Power Levels
    version             Print version information
```

## v0.8.0 - Refactoring

* Refactored pyPowerwall by @emptywee in https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/pull/77 including:
  * Moved Local and Cloud based operation code into respective modules, providing better abstraction and making it easier to maintain and extend going forward.
  * Made meaning of the `jsonformat` parameter consistent across all method calls (breaking API change).
  * Removed Python 2.7 support.
  * Cleaned up code and adopted a more pythoinc style.
* Fixed battery_blocks() for non-vitals systems.

## v0.7.12 - Cachefile, Alerts & Strings

* Added logic to pull string data from `/api/solar_powerwall` API if vitals data is not available by @jasonacox in #76.
* Added alerts from `/api/solar_powerwall` when vitals not present by @DerickJohnson in #75. The vitals API is not present in firmware versions > 23.44, this provides a workaround to get alerts.
* Allow customization of the cachefile location and name by @emptywee in #74 via `cachefile` parameter.

```python
# Example
import pypowerwall
pw = pypowerwall.Powerwall(
     host="10.1.2.30",
     password="secret",
     email="me@example.com",
     timezone="America/Los_Angeles",
     pwcacheexpire=5, 
     timeout=5, 
     poolmaxsize=10,
     cloudmode=False, 
     siteid=None, 
     authpath="", 
     authmode="cookie",
     cachefile=".powerwall",
     )
```

## v0.7.11 - Cooldown Mode

* Updated logic to disable vitals API calls for Firmware 23.44.0+
* Added rate limit detection and cooldown mode to allow Powerwall gateway time to recover.

## v0.7.10 - Cache 404 Responses

* Add cache and extended TTL for 404 responses from Powerwall as identified in issue https://github.com/jasonacox/Powerwall-Dashboard/issues/449. This will help reduce load on Powerwall gateway that may be causing rate limiting for some users (Firmware 23.44.0+).

## v0.7.9 - Cloud Grid Status

* Bug fix for correct grid status for Solar-Only systems on `cloud mode` (see https://github.com/jasonacox/Powerwall-Dashboard/issues/437)

## v0.7.8 - Cloud Fixes

* Fix enumeration of energy sites during `cloud mode` setup to handle incomplete sites with Unknown names or types by @dcgibbons in https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/pull/72 
* Proxy t41 Updates - Bug fixes for Solar-Only systems using `cloud mode` (see https://github.com/jasonacox/Powerwall-Dashboard/issues/437).

## v0.7.7 - Battery Data and Network Scanner

* Proxy t40: Use /api/system_status battery blocks data to augment /pod and /freq macro data APIs by @jasonacox in https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/pull/67 thanks to @ceeeekay in https://github.com/jasonacox/Powerwall-Dashboard/discussions/402#discussioncomment-8193776
* Network Scanner: Improve network scan speed by scanning multiple hosts simultaneously by @mcbirse in https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/pull/67. The number of hosts to scan simultaneously can be adjusted using the optional `-hosts=` argument (default = 30, maximum = 100), e.g. `python -m pypowerwall scan -hosts=50`

## v0.7.6 - 404 Bug Fix

* Fix Critical Bug - 404 HTTP Status Code Handling (Issue https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/issues/65).

## v0.7.5 - Cloud Mode Setup

* Added optional email address argument to Cloud Mode setup (`python -m pypowerwall setup -email=<email>`) by @mcbirse in https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/pull/64 to streamline Powerwall-Dashboard setup script.
* Updated network scanner output to advise Powerwall 3 is supported in Cloud Mode by @mcbirse in https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/pull/64

## v0.7.4 - Bearer Token Auth

pyPowerwall Updates
* This release adds the ability to use a Bearer Token for Authentication for the local Powerwall gateway API calls. This is selectable by defining `authmode='token'` in the initialization. The default mode uses the existing `AuthCookie` and `UserRecord` method.

```python
import pypowerwall

pw = pypowerwall.Powerwall(HOST, PASSWORD, EMAIL, TIMEZONE, authmode="token")
```

Proxy
* The above option is extended to the pyPowerwall Proxy via the environmental variable `PW_AUTH_MODE` set to cookie (default) or token.

Powerwall Network Scanner
* Added optional IP address argument to network scanner by @mcbirse in https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/pull/63. The Scan Function can now accept an additional argument `-ip=` to override the host IP address detection (`python -m pypowerwall scan -ip=192.168.1.100`). This may be useful where the host IP address/network cannot be detected correctly, for instance if pypowerwall is running inside a container.

## v0.7.3 - Cloud Mode Setup

* Setup will now check for `PW_AUTH_PATH` environmental variable to set the path for `.pypowerwall.auth` and `.pypowerwall.site` by @mcbirse in https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/pull/62
* Proxy t37 - Move signal handler to capture SIGTERM when proxy halts due to config error by @mcbirse in https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/pull/62. This ensures a containerized proxy will exit without delay when stopping or restarting the container.

## v0.7.2 - Cloud Auth Path

* Add pypowerwall setting to define path to cloud auth cache and site files in the initialization. It will default to current directory.
* Add pypowerwall setting to define energy site id in the initialization. It will default to None.

```python
import pypowerwall

pw = pypowerwall.Powerwall(email="email@example.com",cloudmode=True,siteid=1234567,authpath=".auth")
```

* Proxy will now use `PW_AUTH_PATH` as an environmental variable to set the path for `.pypowerwall.auth` and `.pypowerwall.site`.
* Proxy also has `PW_SITEID` as an environmental variable to set `siteid`.

## v0.7.1 - Tesla Cloud Mode

* Simulate Powerwall Energy Gateway via Tesla Cloud API calls. In `cloudmode` API calls to pypowerwall APIs will result in calls made to the Tesla API to fetch the data.

Cloud Mode Setup - Use pypowerwall to fetch your Tesla Owners API Token

```bash
python3 -m pypowerwall setup

# Token and site information stored in .pypowerwall.auth and .pypowerwall.site
```

Cloud Mode Code Example

```python
import pypowerwall
pw = pypowerwall.Powerwall(email="email@example.com",cloudmode=True)
pw.power()
# Output: {'site': 2977, 'solar': 1820, 'battery': -3860, 'load': 937}
pw.poll('/api/system_status/soe')
# Output: '{"percentage": 26.403205103271222}'
```

* Added new API function to compute estimated backup time remaining on the battery: `get_time_remaining()`

## v0.6.4 - Power Flow Animation

Proxy t29 Updates
* Default page rendered by proxy (http://pypowerwall:8675/) will render Powerflow Animation
* Animation assets (html, css, js, images, fonts, svg) will render from local filesystem instead of pulling from Powerwall TEG portal.
* Start prep for possible API removals from Powerwall TEG portal (see NOAPI settings)

Powerwall Network Scanner
* Adjust scan timeout default to 1,000ms (1s) to help with more consistent scans.

## v0.6.3 - Powerwall 3 Scan

* Added scan detection for new Powerwall 3 systems. API discovery is still underway so pypowerwall currently does not support Powerwall 3s. See https://github.com/jasonacox/Powerwall-Dashboard/issues/387

```

* Proxy t24: Added new `/alerts/pw` endpoint with dictionary/object response format by @DerickJohnson in https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/pull/26

## v0.6.0 - Add Persistent HTTP Connections

* PyPI 0.6.0
* Added HTTP persistent connections for API requests to Powerwall Gateway by @mcbirse in https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/pull/21
* Requests to Gateway will now re-use persistent http connections which reduces load and increases response time.
* Uses default connection `poolmaxsize=10` to align with Session object defaults. Note: pool use applies to multi-threaded use of pyPowerwall only, e.g. as with the pyPowerwall Proxy Server.
* Added env `PW_POOL_MAXSIZE` to proxy server to allow this to be controlled (persistent connections disabled if set to zero).
* Added env `PW_TIMEOUT` to proxy server to allow timeout on requests to be adjusted.
