# TeslaPy

TeslaPy is a Python API that lets you monitor and control Tesla products remotely. It is based on [unofficial documentation](https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/) of the Tesla Motors Owner API.

## Fork Notice

**Note:** This is a fork of the TeslaPy library, originally forked from version 2.9.0:

https://github.com/tdorssers/TeslaPy

This fork is maintained as part of pypowerwall to provide timely fixes for Tesla API changes. The original TeslaPy repository is no longer actively maintained, and this fork includes pypowerwall-specific patches and updates to maintain compatibility with Tesla's evolving API.

All credit for the original TeslaPy implementation goes to Tim Dorssers. See RELEASE.md for changes made in this fork.
