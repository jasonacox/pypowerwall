Python module to interface with Tesla Energy Gateways for Powerwall and solar power data. Currently supporting local access to Powerwall, Powerwall 2 and Powerwall+ systems and Tesla Owner cloud API for all systems including Solar Only and Powerwall 3 systems.

## Description

This python module can be used to monitor and control Tesla Energy Powerwalls. It uses a single class (`Powerwall`) and simple functions to fetch energy data and
poll API endpoints on the Gateway.  

pyPowerwall will cache the authentication headers and API call responses to help reduce the number of calls made to the Gateway (useful if you are polling the Powerwall frequently for trending data).

* Works with Tesla Energy Gateways - Powerwall and Powerwall+
* Simple access through easy to use functions using customer credentials
* Will cache authentication to reduce load on Powerwall Gateway
* Will cache responses to limit number of calls to Powerwall Gateway (optional/user definable)
* Will re-use http connections to Powerwall Gateway for reduced load and faster response times
* Easy access to decoded binary device vitals (/api/devices/vitals in JSON format)
* Provides solar string data for Powerwall+ systems

NOTE: This module requires that you (or your installer) have set up *Customer Login* credentials
on your Powerwall Gateway.

## Setup

You can clone this repo or install the package with pip.  Once installed, pyPowerwall can scan your local network to find th IP address of your Tesla Powerwall Gateway.

```bash
# Install pyPowerwall
python3 -m pip install pypowerwall

# Scan Network for Powerwalls
python3 -m pypowerwall scan

# (optional) Setup to use Tesla Owners cloud API
python3 -m pypowerwall setup
```

FreeBSD users can install from ports or pkg [FreshPorts](https://www.freshports.org/net-mgmt/py-pypowerwall):

Via pkg:
```bash
# pkg install net-mgmt/py-pypowerwall
```

Via ports:
```bash
# cd /usr/ports/net-mgmt/py-pypowerwall/ && make install clean
```

Note: pyPowerwall installation will attempt to install these required python packages: _requests_, _protobuf_ and _teslapy_.

## Programming with pyPowerwall

After importing pypowerwall, you simply create a handle for your Powerwall device 
and call function to poll data.  Here is an example:

```python
    import pypowerwall

    # Optional: Turn on Debug Mode
    # pypowerwall.set_debug(True)

    # Local Mode - Credentials for your Powerwall - Customer Login
    password='password'
    email='email@example.com'
    host = "10.0.1.123"               # Address of your Powerwall Gateway
    timezone = "America/Los_Angeles"  # Your local timezone

    # (Optional) Cloud Mode - Requires Setup
    password = ""
    email='email@example.com'
    host = ""
    timezone = "America/Los_Angeles"  # Your local timezone
 
    # Connect to Powerwall
    pw = pypowerwall.Powerwall(host,password,email,timezone)

    # Some System Info
    print("Site Name: %s - Firmware: %s - DIN: %s" % (pw.site_name(), pw.version(), pw.din()))
    print("System Uptime: %s\n" % pw.uptime())

    # Pull Sensor Power Data
    grid = pw.grid()
    solar = pw.solar()
    battery = pw.battery()
    home = pw.home()

    # Display Data
    print("Battery power level: %0.0f%%" % pw.level())
    print("Combined power metrics: %r" % pw.power())
    print("")

    # Display Power in kW
    print("Grid Power: %0.2fkW" % (float(grid)/1000.0))
    print("Solar Power: %0.2fkW" % (float(solar)/1000.0))
    print("Battery Power: %0.2fkW" % (float(battery)/1000.0))
    print("Home Power: %0.2fkW" % (float(home)/1000.0))
    print("")

    # Raw JSON Payload Examples
    print("Grid raw: %r\n" % pw.grid(verbose=True))
    print("Solar raw: %r\n" % pw.solar(verbose=True))

    # Display Device Vitals
    print("Vitals: %r\n" % pw.vitals())

    # Display String Data
    print("String Data: %r\n" % pw.strings())

```

## Tools

The following are some useful tools based on pypowerwall:

* [Powerwall Proxy](proxy) - Use this caching proxy to handle authentication to the Powerwall Gateway and make basic read-only API calls to /api/meters/aggregates (power metrics), /api/system_status/soe (battery level) and many [others](https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/blob/main/proxy/HELP.md). This is useful for metrics gathering tools like telegraf to pull metrics without needing to authenticate. Because pyPowerwall is designed to cache the auth and high frequency API calls, this will also reduce the load on the Gateway and prevent crash/restart issues that can happen if too many session are created on the Gateway.

* [Powerwall Simulator](simulator) - A Powerwall simulator to mimic the responses from the Tesla Powerwall Gateway. This is useful for testing purposes.

* [Powerwall Dashboard](https://github.com/jasonacox/Powerwall-Dashboard#powerwall-dashboard) - Monitoring Dashboard for the Tesla Powerwall using Grafana, InfluxDB, Telegraf and pyPowerwall.

## Powerwall Scanner

pyPowerwall has a built in feature to scan your network for available Powerwall gateways.  This will help you find the IP address of your Powerwall.

```bash
# Install pyPowerwall if you haven't already
python -m pip install pypowerwall

# Scan Network for Powerwalls
python -m pypowerwall scan
```

Example Output
```
pyPowerwall Network Scanner [0.1.2]

    Your network appears to be: 10.0.1.0/24

    Enter Network or press enter to use 10.0.1.0/24:

| 22.18.3 21c0ad81 | 28-Jun-2022 | Two new alerts did show up in device vitals: HighCPU and SystemConnectedToGrid * The HighCPU was particularly interesting. If you updated your customer password on the gateway, it seems to have reverted during the firmware upgrade. Any monitoring tools using the new password were getting errors. The gateway was presenting "API rate limit" errors (even for installer mode). Reverting the password to the older one fixes the issue but revealed the HighCPU alert. | v0.4.0 Proxy t15 | 4.9.2-1087 |
| 22.18.6 7884188e | 27-Sep-2022 | STSTSM HighCPU Alert appeared after upgrade. The firmwareVersion now shows "2022-08-01-g8b6399632f". Alerts during upgrade: "PINV_a010_can_gtwMIA", "PINV_a039_can_thcMIA". | v0.4.0 Proxy t15 | 4.13.1-1312 |
| 22.26.1-foxtrot 4d562eaf | 13-Oct-2022 | This release seems to have introduced a Powerwall charging slowdown mode. After 95% full, the charging will slow dramatically with excess solar production getting pushed to the grid even if the battery is less than 100% (see [discussion](https://github.com/jasonacox/Powerwall-Dashboard/discussions/109)).  This upgrade also upgrades the Neurio Revenue Grade Meter (RGM) to 1.7.2-Tesla with STSTSM firmware showing 2022-09-28-g7cb0d69c2b.

#### STSTSM - Tesla Energy System

* Details
    * This appears to be the primary control unit for the Tesla Energy Systems. 
    * ECU Type is 207
    * Part Numbers: 1232100-XX-Y, 1152100-XX-Y, 1118431-xx-y
    * Tesla Gateway 1 (1118431-xx-y) or Tesla Gateway 2 (1232100-xx-y)
    * Tesla Backup Switch (1624171-xx-y)

* Alerts
    * BackfeedLimited - The system is configured for inadvertent export and therefore will not further discharge to respect this limit. It appears this controls backfeed before PTO, under the "Permission to Operate" option under the settings menu. Prior to PTO the backfeed rate is limited, as the system needs to produce over the load, but by the minimum possible. The system seems to regulate this by switching MCI's open/closed, to minimize the overage that must be backfed, as the power has to go somewhere, and at this point the batteries are 100%. This seems to toggle that setting per inverter.
    * BatteryBreakerOpen - Battery disabled via breaker
    * BatteryComms - Communication issue with Battery
    * BatteryFault - Powerwall Failure
    * BatteryUnexpectedPower - Commanded real power does not match measured power from battery meter.
    * CANUsageAlert - Unknown

    * PanelMaxCurrentLimited
    * PodCommissionTimeError - Unknown but happened when some of the Powerwalls failed during a firmware upgrade and was disabled (see [discussion](https://github.com/jasonacox/Powerwall-Dashboard/discussions/47))
    * PodCommissionTime - Unknown
    * PVInverterComms - Communication issue with Solar Inverter (abnormal)
    * RealPowerAvailableLimited - The command is greater than the Available Battery Real Charge or Discharge Power (seen when Powerwall 100% full). Seems related to BackfeedLimited.
    * RealPowerConfigLimited - The system is unable to meet the commanded power because a limit that was configured during commissioning
    * ScheduledIslandContactorOpen - Manually Disconnected from Grid (nominal)
    * SelfConsumptionReservedLimit - Battery reached reserve limit during self-consumption mode and switches to grid (nominal)
